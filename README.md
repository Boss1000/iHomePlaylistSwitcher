iHomePlaylistSwitcher
=====================

Another early dive into Python coding!

Checks the day of the week and changes the playlist in iTunes called "iHome" to whatever is pre-set for that day

I'll fill this out with more concrete instructions once it works. How 'bout that? :)

I discovered that the XML file I was editing to change the playlist is not the file iTunes uses to operate. It's a copy for external use of the .itl file iTunes actively uses. Which is binary and not human-readable.

So effectively the code as it is will not be helpful in the slightest in automating this effort. It was still a learning experience with Python and element trees, however. I may investigate other programs that will be able to work with this program in the future.
